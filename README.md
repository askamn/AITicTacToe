# AITicTacToe
An AI vs. Human Tic Tac Toe Implementation in Java using MiniMax Algorithm.

For more information on the minimax algorithm for TicTacToe, refer to this article: http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax

I also add a class Applet_Main for exporting the game as an Applet.

## Running

You need to have `javac` and `java` in path. You can execute the provided batch script to build and compile the program in the following manner:
`build_and_run.bat`

A shell script is also provided to run the app in OSX and Linux GUI flavours but it is untested.
